	Most coupons are redeemed during a new subscription. 
	This endpoint allows you to redeem a coupon for a customer after their initial 
	subscription, or in anticipation of a future subscription. When you redeem a 
	coupon on an account, the coupon will be applied to the next subscription creation 
	(new subscription), modification (e.g. upgrade or downgrade), or renewal.
