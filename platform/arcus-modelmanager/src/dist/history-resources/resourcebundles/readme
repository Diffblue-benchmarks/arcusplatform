This directory contains properties files that will automatically be upsert into the cassandra table
every time the model manager is run.

The file naming convention is as follows.

<bundle_name>_<locale_name>.properties

Where
   <bundle_name> is the name of the bundle (ex. history)
   <locale_name> is the name of the locale (ex. en or en_US)

If only <bundle_name> is provided the default locale of en will be used.  For example history.properties
will result in all keys within the history.properties file having a locale of en.
