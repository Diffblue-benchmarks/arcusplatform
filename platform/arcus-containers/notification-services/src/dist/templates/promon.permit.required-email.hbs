Hi {{{_person.firstName}}},

Local emergency responders require you to have an alarm dispatch permit on file. 
The authorities will ask for your permit code during the dispatch process. Failure 
to obtain and enter permit information may result in fines, and emergency 
responders may not respond. 

Contact your local city office to request your dispatch permit. Add the permit 
code to Settings>Place when you receive the information.
