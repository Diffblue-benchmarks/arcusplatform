Your Arcus Service Has Been Downgraded to Basic
{{/section}}

{{#section "plaintext-body"}}
Hi {{{_person.firstName}}},

Your most recent payment was declined. The credit card information you entered 
has failed to process. Your Arcus service has been downgraded to the Basic Service.

This note means that in the event of a Security, Smoke, CO, or Panic alarm, the 
Monitoring Station will not call you and emergency responders will not be dispatched. 
If you've paired a cellular modem, subscribe to the Backup Cellular add-on plan in the 
next 80 days to keep your modem active.  

Upgrade your service plan at {{{_redirectBaseUrl}}}/e_prodowngrade.
