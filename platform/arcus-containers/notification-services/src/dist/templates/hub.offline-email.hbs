Hub Lost Connection
{{/section}}

{{#section "plaintext-body"}}
Hi {{{_person.firstName}}},

The hub at {{{_owner.firstName}}} {{{_owner.lastName}}}'s place ({{{_place.name}}})
lost its connection to the Arcus cloud platform on {{{offlineTime}}}. You
will not be able to remotely monitor, control devices, or receive alerts until it
is reconnected. This may be due to a loss of Internet connection, or the hub is not
receiving power.
To restore service, please try the following:
1. Confirm that the hub has AC power.
2. Check the backup batteries.
3. Restart your router.
4. Check your internet connection.
If your hub is still not connected, you may need to press the reset button on the back of the hub for 2 seconds.
You will receive an email when the hub is reconnected.
